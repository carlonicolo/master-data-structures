# Master DataStructures in Python

Implementation of the following datastructures:

* Nodes
* LinkedList
* Queue
* Stack
* DoubleLinkedList

Showing how to perform profiling and demonstrate that Queue with LinkedList is faster (having linear time) than  
using Queue with python list standard libraries.
